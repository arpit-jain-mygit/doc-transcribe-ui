# Product Backlog (Top-Level)

This is the single entry point for product and delivery planning across this project.

## Backlog links

1. NFR / Production Readiness Backlog  
- [Production Readiness & Scalability Backlog](./PRODUCTION_READINESS_BACKLOG.md)

2. Agentic AI Backlog  
- [Agentic AI Backlog](./AGENTIC_AI_BACKLOG.md)

## How to use

1. Start with NFR backlog for platform reliability, security, observability, scale, and quality gates.
2. Move to Agentic AI backlog for intelligent workflow capabilities (`Agent #1` to `Agent #10`).
3. Keep status and test evidence updated in the linked backlog files.

## Current sequencing guidance

1. Complete/maintain NFR baseline and regression discipline.
2. Implement Agent #1 to Agent #10 in defined order.
3. Defer RAG epic (`PRS-045`) until agent backlog items are stable.
